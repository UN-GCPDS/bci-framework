Is possible to save a custom montage, and reuse it or load one from a set of pre-configured montages. The Daisy board is configured automatically depending on the montage selected.\n",

All this information is automatically available through any interface and can be consulted on execution time from any extension: [Stimuli delivery](80-develop_stimuli_delivery.ipynb#properties), [Data analysis](70-develop_data_analysis.ipynb#properties), and [Data visualizations](75-develop_visualizations.ipynb#properties).\n",
