BCI-Framework is an open-source tool for the acquisition of EEG/EMG/ECG
signals, developed to work with `OpenBCI’s Cyton
board <https://shop.openbci.com/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel?variant=38958638542>`__,
the main core of this software lies on
`OpenBCI-Stream <https://openbci-stream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__,
a library designed to handle all the `low-level hardware
features <https://docs.openbci.com/docs/02Cyton/CytonSDK>`__ and extend
the hardware capabilities with high-level programming libraries.

An optionally distributed paradigm for data acquisition and streaming is
available to be implemented, this approach stabilizes the sampling rate
on non-real-time acquisition systems and consists on delegate the board
handle to a dedicated environ and stream out the data in real-time.
`Write custom visualization <70-develop_visualizations.ipynb>`__ for raw
or processed time series and `design custom neurophysiological
experiments <80-stimuli_delivery.ipynb>`__ are the major features
available in this application.

BCI-Framework comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) with a set of
individual computational processes (distributed or in a single machine),
that feed a visualization, serve a stimuli delivery, handle an
acquisition, storage data, or stream a previous one (offline analysis).
It has a built-in development environment and a set of libraries that
the user can implement to create their specific functionality.
