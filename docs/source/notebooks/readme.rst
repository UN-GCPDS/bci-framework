OpenBCI specializes in creating low-cost, high-quality biosensing
hardware for brain computer interfacing. Our arduino compatible
biosensing boards provide high resolution imaging and recording of EMG,
ECG, and EEG signals. Our devices have been used by researchers, makers,
and hobbyists in over 60+ countries as brain computer interfaces to
power machines and map brain activity. OpenBCI headsets, boards, sensors
and electrodes allow anyone interested in biosensing and neurofeedback
to purchase high quality equipment at affordable prices.

BCI-Framework provide a software for handle
`OpeBCI <https://openbci.com/>`__ boards, an environment for develop
real time EEG/EMG/ECG data visualizations and a

It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a
universal, reusable software environment that provides particular
functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate
development of software applications, products and solutions. Software
frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool
sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together
all the different components to enable development of a project or
system.
