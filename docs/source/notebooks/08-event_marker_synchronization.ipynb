    "Is possible to take advantage of the OpenBCI construction, this board includes a set of analog and digital inputs that can be used to synchronize markers. Other systems will need a piece of additional laboratory equipment like [LabStreamer](https://www.neurobs.com/menu_presentation/menu_hardware/labstreamer) that can register time with microseconds precision. In order to use OpenBCI, we will only need an _LDR module_ connected to the pin **D11** (or **A5**) and start the automatic latency correction system. This method is similar to the one implemented by <cite data-footcite=\"davis2020stimulus\">davis2020stimulus</cite>."

    "This simple latency correction consists of a stimuli delivery with only a marker synchronization area, the _LDR module_ is constantly sensing (the [boardmode](02-interface.ipynb#Connection) must be in `analog`) so the changes on the square signal are compared with streamed markers and then the latency is corrected. The latency correction **only affects the current session**, if the framework is restarted this calibration will lose. \n",
