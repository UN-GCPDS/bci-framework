    "**Connection:**  \n",
    "Serial device through USB dongle and WiFi through WiFi shield.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IP:**  \n",
    "Port: Serial port address, like /dev/ttyUSB0 or COM0  \n",
    "IP: Ip address for WiFi shield, it could be in master or slave mode.\n",

    "**Latency (under TCP):**  \n",
    "The time in microseconds (us) between packet sends. The higher the OpenBCI sample rate, the higher the latency needed. Default is **1000us**, minimum stable is **50us**. For upper limit sample rates such as 4kHz/8kHz/16kHz, latency around **20000us** seems to really stabilize the system.\n",

    "**Host:**  \n",
    "On <a href=\"https://openbci-stream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/A4-server-based_acquisition.html\">distributed acquisition</a> this is the IP from machine where Cyton board is connected, if the board is connected in this same machine, the the IP is just localhost.\n",

    "**Acquisition sample rate:**  \n",
    "Over serial connections only is available 250 samples per second, over WiFi up to 16k with 8 channels, and 8k for 16 channels.\n",

    "**Streaming package size:**  \n",
    "The stream will attempt to write packages of this size, a lower value will reduce the latency for real-time but increase the computational processing. A high value will be easy to proceess but will have a big delay.\n",

    "  * _Default:_ Sends accelerometer data in aux bytes\n",
    "  * _Debug:_ Sends serial output over the external serial port which is helpful for debugging.\n",
    "  * _Analog:_ Reads from analog pins A5(D11), A6(D12) and if no wifi shield is present, then A7(D13) as well.\n",
    "  * _Digital:_ Reads from analog pins D11, D12 and D17. If no wifi present then also D13 and D18.\n",
    "  * _Marker:_ Turns accel off and injects markers into the stream by sending \\`X where X is any char to add to the first AUX byte.\n",
