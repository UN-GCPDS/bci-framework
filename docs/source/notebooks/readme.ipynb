    "BCI-Framework is an open-source tool for the acquisition of EEG/EMG/ECG signals, it is developed to work with [OpenBCI's Cyton board](https://shop.openbci.com/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel?variant=38958638542), the main core of this software lies on [OpenBCI-Stream](https://openbci-stream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a library that has been designed to handle all the [low-level hardware features](https://docs.openbci.com/docs/02Cyton/CytonSDK) and extend the hardware capabilities with high-level programming libraries. An optionally distributed paradigm for data acquisition and streaming is available to be implemented, this approach stabilizes the sampling rate on non-real-time acquisition systems and consists on delegate the board handle to a dedicated environ and stream out the data in real-time. [Write custom visualization](70-develop_visualizations.ipynb) for raw or processed time series and [design custom neurophysiological experiments](80-develop_stimuli_delivery.ipynb) are the mayor features available in this application.\n",
    "\n",
    "BCI-Framework consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) with a set of individual computational processes (distributed or in a single machine), that feed a visualization, serve a stimuli delivery, handle an acquisition, storage data, or stream a previous one (offline analysis). It has a built-in development environment and a set of libraries that can be implemented by the user to create their specific functionality."
